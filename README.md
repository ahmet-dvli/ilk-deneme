 Hello everyone --- My name is Ahmet. I am currently studying Information Security Technology.
In this repository you will find my experiments, drafts and projects related to what I learn and build.


## What to expect 
•⁠  ⁠Small nmap scripts and examples
•⁠  ⁠NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) experiments
•⁠  ⁠Notes and drafts from my labs and practice sessions

## NOTE 
These materials are made to be used for learning and testing in authorized environments. Do not run scans or attacks against systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.
